Installing ALEX3
-----------------

Information updated on Dec-07-2014 by JJGC

ALEX3 needs the following libraries:
Irene: -- MC "true" information from NEXUS, the MC generator of NEXT
URL: svn://next.ific.uv.es/svn/next/irene/trunk

Paolina: A library that allows voxelisation of tracks.

URL: svn://next.ific.uv.es/svn/next/paolina/branches/paolina.2.0

Log4CPP: A library for simple logging

http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net

RecPack: A library for Kalman Filter analysis
URL: svn://next.ific.uv.es/svn/sw/recpack/trunk

CLHEP: Vector and matrix clases, system of units (used mainly by RecPack)
TinyXML2: A simple XML parser
http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2docs/

ROOT: The uber-library for HEP or the mother of all evil
http://root.cern.ch/drupal/

At the moment, ALEX3 is using version 5.34/18

The CMakeLists.txt specifies the command

find_package(Irene REQUIRED)
find_package(Paolina REQUIRED)
find_package(Log4CPP REQUIRED)
find_package(RecPack REQUIRED)
find_package(CLHEP REQUIRED)
find_package(TinyXML2 REQUIRED)
find_package(ROOT REQUIRED)

Which implies that you should have in your alex3 source directory a subdirectory call cmake and inside cmake a directory called Modules. Inside Modules:

FindCLHEP.cmake    FindLog4CPP.cmake  FindROOT.cmake     FindTinyXML2.cmake
FindIrene.cmake    FindPaolina.cmake  FindRecPack.cmake

All the modules except the one used to find ROOT, are pretty trivial. The ROOT module requires that you have installed ROOT and can run the command root-config. If you have defined properly the variable ROOTSYS pointing to your ROOT installation everything should be OK. 

For the rest of the libraries we don't use the xxx-config command. Rather, you need to define a few environment variables in your profile.

As an example, my profile contains the following definitions:

export DEVELOPMENT=/Users/jjgomezcadenas/Development
export NEXT=$DEVELOPMENT/NEXT
export IRENE=$NEXT/irene
export IRENE_DIR=$IRENE
export PAOLINA=$NEXT/paolina
export PAOLINA_DIR=$PAOLINA

export LOG4CPP_DIR=/usr/local
export RECPACK_DIR=/usr/local
export TINYXML2_DIR=/usr/local
export CLHEP_DIR=/usr/local
export CLHEP_VERSION=2.1.4.1
export TINYXML2_VERSION=2.2.1.0

Notice that the environment variables simply point to your installation. The system assumes that Irene, Paolina and Log4CPP libraries are simply called libirene.dylib (or .so) libapaolina.dylib and liblog4cpp.dylib. Instead, since tinyxml and CLHEP are versioned, we define two extra variables to allow for the version to be used. 

---
In your profile you also need to define your "alex workind directory" (the place where you place your algorithms)
The environment variable to set is AWDIR. As an example:

export DEVELOPMENT=/Users/jjgomezcadenas/Development
export DEVNEXT=$DEVELOPMENT/devnext
export ALEX=$DEVNEXT/alex3
export AWDIR=$ALEX/jjalgos
